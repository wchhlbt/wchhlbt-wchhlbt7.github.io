Now, I am a visiting scholar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. Gang Wang. My research interests include Web Security, Network Security, and Internet Measurement. Currently, I focus on email-related security research. I have published 6 papers at all top-tier academic conferences on network security, including Oakland S\u0026amp;P, USENIX Security, CCS, NDSS. My research results have helped Google, Apple, Yandex, Tencent, Shopee and other well-known Internet companies to fix vulnerabilities. As a member of Redbud, a CTF team belonging to Tsinghua University, I have won the ByteCTF 2020 championship and other CTF awards.\nRecent News [02/2024] It‚Äôs my pleasure to present our work about SPF vulnerabilities at NDSS 2024, in San Diego.
